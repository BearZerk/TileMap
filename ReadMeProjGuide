# TileMap
Personal TileMap project for 2D potential 3D extension

Project Plan Overview
    - Create 2D TileManager (sidescroller/platformer potential) [Master]
        - Extend to 3D TileManager (Voxel based idea, similar to CubeWorld Alpha by Wolfram) [Branch]
            - Extend 3D TileManager to use Perlin Noise which can start to populate a landscape? [Branch]

Tile Manager
  - 2D Array
  - Populate with TileObjects
  - OnStart() - draw contents of 2D array to screen. 
  //Need to research how to edit tilemange within scene view so maps can be created.
    ////Custom Brush & Custom Inspector
  //if array[][] has no gameobject draw an empty object -> no components, alpha sprite with translucent boarder
