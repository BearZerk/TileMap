# TileMap
Personal TileMap project for 2D potential 3D extension

Project Plan Overview
    - Create 2D TileManager (sidescroller/platformer potential) [Master]
        - Extend to 3D TileManager (Voxel based idea, similar to CubeWorld Alpha by Wolfram) [Branch]
            - Extend 3D TileManager to use Perlin Noise which can start to populate a landscape? [Branch]

Tile Manager
    - Tile Selection
        + Provide a list of sprites/prefabs within the inspector
    - Tile Map Creation
        + Creation of an in-scene mapping for tiles to be placed upon
            = 2D Array [width][height]
            = OnLoad - traverse 2D Array exhaustively until the point of EoA, draw prefab associated with element ID 

28/08/2017:
    Whilst most tutorials have fallen short, or maybe key-words for searching haven't hit the mark there has been some familiarisation
    through Yudiz (http://www.yudiz.com/making-a-basic-2d-tile-map-editor-using-a-custom-inspector/) Used most of this as a tutorial, 
    need to complete the tutorial to appreciate what parts of my plan are missing, what parts can be transposed and what parts fall 
    woefully short of my needs for now (that can be built upon).
